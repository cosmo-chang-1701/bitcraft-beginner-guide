# Chapter 1: Welcome to the Wilderness: Understanding the World of BitCraft

Before embarking on your journey, the most crucial step is to understand BitCraft's core philosophy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Core Philosophy**: BitCraft is a "Massively Multiplayer Community Sandbox Game" where the ultimate goal is for all players to "rebuild civilization together." The game encourages diverse playstyles such as farming, trading, hunting, city-building, and social strategy, rather than simple combat grinding.

### The Game Philosophy of BitCraft

The world of BitCraft is a single, massive, and seamless wilderness where all players interact on the same server. Everything you do, from cutting down a tree to laying a road, makes a "permanent change" to this world. This means your actions are not just for personal survival but are writing a new page in the history of this world.

This design philosophy elevates the game's core from a simple "player versus environment" to a "society versus chaos" level. The true depth of the game lies in observing how the player community spontaneously organizes, establishes economic systems, social structures, and ultimately forms empires that span continents and oceans. Therefore, rather than seeing it as "Minecraft with more people," it's better understood as a continuously evolving, player-driven civilization simulator, where survival and crafting are the fundamental means to achieve this grand goal.

### What Kind of Game Is This?

BitCraft skillfully blends multiple game genres to create a unique experience:

- **Survival Game**: You will awaken with nothing and need to gather resources and build shelter to survive.
- **Sandbox Game**: The entire world is editable, allowing you to freely shape the landscape and develop your character without being bound by fixed classes.
- **Role-Playing Game (RPG)**: The game features a deep skill system where your character masters specific skills through "practice" rather than point allocation.
- **City-Building and Strategy Game**: You can cooperate with others to grow from a small village into a prosperous city, and even establish a vast empire.

### The Early Access Journey

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Early Access Notice**: BitCraft is currently in "Early Access." This means the game content is still being added to and refined, and the development team will adjust the game based on player feedback. During this period, occasional server wipes may occur for balance and system adjustments.

The development team, Clockwork Labs, maintains great openness with the community and even plans to open-source the game's code in the future. This reaffirms the core spirit of the game: it is a world shaped and owned by all its players.
