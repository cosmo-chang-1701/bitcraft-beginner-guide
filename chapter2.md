# Chapter 2: Your First Steps: From Account Creation to First-Day Survival

This chapter provides a clear process to guide you smoothly into the game world and safely through the crucial first few hours.

### Pre-Game Checklist

1.  **Create an Account**: First, go to the "Account Hub" on the official BitCraft website to create an account. Afterward, you will receive a verification email; be sure to click the link in it to activate your account. Sometimes the email may go to your spam folder, so remember to check.
2.  **Obtain a Game Key**: During the Early Access phase, you need to purchase the game on Steam to get a key. The previous random invite testing method is no longer applicable.
3.  **Check System Requirements**: Before purchasing, please ensure your computer meets the game's minimum system requirements.

### Awakening in Starfell: Your First Day

**Note**: When you first enter the game, be aware that any officially released early "first-day" tutorial videos may be outdated. Please refer to them with caution.

Here is our recommended starting process:

1.  **Follow the Wisp**: When the game starts, a wisp will guide you through the initial tasks. Be sure to follow its guidance, as it will help you learn the basic controls and eventually obtain one of the most critical tools in the game: the **Cart**.
2.  **Find a "Ruined Town"**: This is the most important objective for a newcomer. These pre-generated towns are intentionally designed as "newbie incubators." They are not a design flaw but a core support mechanism provided by the developers to solve the "cold start" problem of sandbox games. Trying to be a lone wolf in the wilderness from day one will be extremely difficult.
3.  **Utilize Public Facilities**: In the ruined towns, all workstations (like forges and carpentry tables), banks, and markets are public and free to use. This greatly reduces the initial survival pressure for new players, as you don't need to build everything from scratch.
4.  **Activate a "Ruined Waystone"**: Find and interact with a waystone in the town. This will unlock the fast travel feature, allowing you to teleport between visited towns, which is key to exploring the vast world.
5.  **Set Your "Home"**: Set a location in a town as your "Home" as soon as possible. It serves not only as your respawn point but also provides an extremely cheap or even free teleportation point, making it convenient to return fully loaded after an expedition.
