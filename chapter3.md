# Chapter 3: The Compendium: Your Most Powerful Tool

If the Cart is an extension of your physical strength, then the "Compendium" is your in-game brain. Mastering this system is the first step from being a novice to becoming an expert.

### Access and Navigation

You can open the Compendium at any time by pressing the `C` key, or by holding `Alt` and left-clicking on an item. It is primarily divided into seven sections: Items, Cargo, Creatures, Resources, Structures, Collection, and Knowledge.

### The Recipe Unlock Cycle

The Compendium is at the core of BitCraft's self-directed exploration philosophy. It replaces a traditional quest log, encouraging players to learn by interacting with the world. Your goal should be to "fill the Compendium," which will drive you to explore and experiment purposefully.

**The Core Learning Loop**:

1.  **Discover New Things**: When you gather or craft a new item, if it can unlock other recipes, a yellow question mark `?` will appear next to its icon.
2.  **Learn the Recipe**: Move these items with a question mark into your personal inventory, and the new related recipes will be automatically unlocked and recorded in the Compendium.
3.  **Form a Feedback Loop**: This process creates a positive cycle: explore to find new materials -> gather them -> unlock new recipes in the Compendium -> craft new items -> which may in turn unlock more recipes.

### Using the Compendium Strategically

- **Tracking Resources**: This is one of the most useful features. Select a resource you want to find in the Compendium (e.g., a specific ore or tree) and click the "Track" button. The game will then highlight nearby resource nodes of the same type on your map and in your field of view, greatly increasing your gathering efficiency.
- **Reverse-Engineering Production Chains**: When viewing any item, the Compendium provides three key tabs: "Info," "Obtain," and "Use."
  - The **Obtain** tab details everything required to craft or gather the item, including tools, profession levels, and materials.
  - The **Use** tab shows all known recipes that use the item as a material.

By using these two tabs, you can easily reverse-engineer the production chain of any complex item, allowing you to plan your production and trade strategies.
