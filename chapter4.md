# Chapter 4: The Pillars of Progression: Mastering Professions and Skills

BitCraft's character progression system is divided into two main categories: "Professions" and "Skills." Understanding their differences and interrelations is key to planning your development path.

### Professions vs. Skills: What's the Difference?

- **Professions**: There are 12 in total. They are the main economic activities in the game, focusing on the gathering, creation, and refinement of resources. They are the foundation of settlement development and item production. You level up professions by performing the relevant actions, such as chopping trees to gain "Forestry" experience.
- **Skills**: There are 6 in total. These are broad activities that all players will engage in, such as construction, cooking, and slaying. One of the most efficient ways to gain skill experience is by completing quests offered by "Travelers."

### Strategic Specialization

BitCraft's profession system is intentionally designed to make it difficult for a single player to master all fields. High-level crafting often requires materials from multiple professions, making specialization and trade a necessity for efficient development, not an option.

- **Solo Players**: It is recommended to focus on a pair of related gathering and crafting professions, such as "Forestry" and "Carpentry," or "Mining" and "Smithing." This allows you to become self-sufficient in a specific product line.
- **Team Players**: It is highly recommended that team members choose different, complementary professions. For example, one person specializes in mining and smithing, another in forestry and carpentry, and a third in hunting and leatherworking. Such a combination can efficiently produce complex finished goods and meet each other's needs through internal trade, which is one of the core concepts of the game's design.
