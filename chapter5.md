# Chapter 5: The Cycle of Creation: A Deep Dive into Gathering, Crafting, and Building

This chapter will break down the core loop you will constantly repeat in the game, helping you understand and optimize your production efficiency.

### Gathering the World's Resources

Resources in the world exist as "resource nodes" and are categorized by type (wood, ore, stone, etc.) and tier (Tier I to X). For example, Tier I resources include Beech Trees, Limestone, and Ferralith Ore. Remember, using the Compendium's tracking feature is the most efficient way to find them.

### The Art of Crafting

Crafting items requires specific "workstations." When you interact with a workstation, the interface clearly displays:

- **Left Side**: A list of recipes you have unlocked that can be crafted at this station.
- **Middle**: Detailed information about the selected item, including the required profession level, tools, and the "Effort" needed to craft it.
- **Right Side**: A list of materials required to craft the item.

Workstations are divided into two types: "active" and "passive." Active workstations require you to be present and operating them but provide profession experience. Passive workstations (like a Smelter) can continue to operate after you leave but do not grant experience upon completion.

### Building Your World

Unlike some sandbox games, building in BitCraft uses a "prefab" system rather than block-by-block construction. Buildings are mainly categorized as workstations, storage facilities, special structures (like wells and waystones), and housing (like tents and cabins). A significant convenience is that as long as a building is within your claimed land, it can be freely repositioned at any time after construction without needing to be demolished and rebuilt.

### Understanding Production Chains

BitCraft's crafting system is not a simple one-to-one conversion but is built on complex "production chains." Understanding and optimizing these chains is key to improving efficiency. Take farming, for example: a complete cycle is gathering wild seeds -> making fertilizer at a farming station -> planting crops in a field -> harvesting and then returning to the farming station to extract new seeds and fibers.

This micro-cycle reveals the game's underlying logic: the creation of any advanced item may require multiple steps, different workstations, and intermediate materials from various professions. Therefore, you need to learn to think in terms of a "supply chain," considering, "What is the full process to make this item? Which parts can I do myself, and which would be more efficient to acquire through trade?"
