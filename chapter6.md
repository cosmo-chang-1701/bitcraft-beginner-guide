# Chapter 6: The Social Structure: Economy, Settlements, and Empires

Once you have mastered the skills of personal survival, you can begin to explore BitCraft's grander social systems. These systems will guide you from being an independent individual to a member of a vast social structure.

### The Player-Driven Economy

- **Travelers**: These NPCs are key to the early-game economy. They are not just merchants but also quest givers. Fulfilling their demand quests will earn you the main currency, "Hex Coins," and valuable skill experience. Traveler quests refresh every 4 hours, and the quests each player receives are unique, which encourages cooperation and trade among players.
- **Regional Marketplace**: Each settlement (including the initial ruined towns) has its own independent market. The prices of items are determined entirely by local supply and demand.
- **Becoming a Merchant**: You can use the "Market Search" interface (hotkey `J`) to view the buy and sell orders of all the markets you have visited. This makes "buy low, sell high" arbitrage possible and is an important way to make a profit in the game.

### From Claim to Settlement

The game's social system is a tiered pyramid that guides players from individual survival to a collective vision.

1.  **Base Layer (Individual)**: Focus on personal survival and skill improvement.
2.  **Second Layer (Claim)**: This is the first step into society. By placing a "Claim Totem," you can own a piece of land. At this point, your goal shifts from pure survival to resource management, as you need to continuously provide "supplies" to the totem to prevent it from decaying. If the supplies run out, your land will become public, and anyone can take your items.
3.  **Third Layer (Settlement)**: When you have accumulated enough wealth (5000 Hex Coins and 10 Codexes), you can purchase a "Writ of Settlement Foundation" from an NPC to formally establish a settlement. At this point, your role transforms from a "landowner" to a "mayor." Your goal is no longer personal development but how to attract other players to settle. You will need to purchase "Business Vouchers" from Travelers to invite them to set up in your settlement, thereby providing public services like a market and a bank.
4.  **Top Layer (Empire)**: This is the pinnacle of the social pyramid. When multiple cities unite, they can form an empire. Gameplay at the empire level shifts towards strategy and politics.

### The Peak of Power: Empires

**The Honor of an Empire**: The core of conflict between empires is **status and prestige, not tangible combat bonuses**. The rewards for becoming an emperor or joining a powerful empire are cosmetic, such as ornate crowns, unique titles, and capes bearing the empire's emblem. The greatest honor is seeing your empire's flag flying over a vast territory on the world map.

The mechanics of imperial conflict revolve around the construction and siege of "Watchtowers," which require a rare resource called "Hexite Capsules." This is a deep strategy game that requires long-term planning, resource networks, and diplomatic skill.
