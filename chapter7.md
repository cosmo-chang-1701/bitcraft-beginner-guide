### Efficiency-Boosting Tips

- **The Cart is King**: To reiterate, complete the tutorial quests as soon as possible to get the cart. Some heavy items in the game are classified as "Cargo," and your backpack can only carry one at a time. The cart, however, can carry up to 10 cargo items, making it an indispensable tool for large-scale gathering.
- **Master Teleportation**: Traveling via waystones consumes "teleport energy," and the cost increases with the number of items in your backpack. Therefore, travel as lightly as possible when exploring. Use the low cost of the "Return Home" teleport as your primary means of returning fully loaded. Note that deployed items like carts will not teleport with you.
- **Utilize Local Storage**: Materials in any storage container placed near a workstation (such as your cart) can be used directly during crafting, saving you a significant amount of time organizing items.
- **Level Up with Traveler Quests**: In the early game, completing Traveler quests is the most efficient way to gain skill experience and a steady income of Hex Coins.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Ignoring Ruined Towns**: Don't try to go it alone in the wilderness from the start. Make full use of the free public facilities in the ruined towns to get on your feet.
- **Hoarding "Question Mark" Items**: Don't let items with a yellow question mark sit in your storage. Immediately move them to your personal inventory to unlock new recipes.
- **Inefficient Travel**: Don't teleport around with a full inventory; it will quickly drain your energy. Learn to plan your logistics routes.
- **Trying to Master Everything**: Don't try to level up all 12 professions at once. Focus on one or two in the beginning to reach higher tiers faster, and rely on the market to acquire other items you need.

### A Note on Combat (PvE)

While combat is not the core of BitCraft, it is still an essential part of taming the dangerous wilderness. You will encounter monsters guarding rare resources or beasts threatening your settlement's safety. There is a skill called "Slayer" directly related to combat. The development team also plans to add more PvE content in the future, such as small dungeons and more challenging enemies, to enrich the combat experience.
